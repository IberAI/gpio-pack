# GPIO Driver Documentation for Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This GPIO driver provides an interface between the Linux kernel and the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. It enables users to control GPIO pins through a simple file interface found in `/proc/ibr-gpio`. The driver is designed for flexibility and ease of use in both development and educational contexts.

## How It Works

### Memory Mapping

The Raspberry Pi's GPIO registers are memory-mapped, meaning they are accessible directly from the processor via specific memory addresses. This driver maps these registers into its own address space using `ioremap`, allowing the driver to manipulate the GPIO pins by reading from and writing to these addresses.

### Pin Control Mechanism

#### Turning a Pin On

To turn a GPIO pin on, the driver first determines the correct register (`fsel`) and bit positions based on the provided pin number:
- **fsel_index**: Identifies which of the several function select registers (`GPFSELn`) the pin configuration bits for the desired pin are located in.
- **fsel_bitpos**: Identifies the bit position within the register for setting the pin mode (input, output, etc.).

The pin is then set to output mode, and the corresponding bit in the output set register (`GPSETn`) is written to '1' to turn the pin on.

#### Turning a Pin Off

Turning a pin off involves a similar calculation for the register and bit position. However, instead of modifying a function select register, the appropriate bit in the output clear register (`GPCLRn`) is written to '1'. This action clears the pin, setting it to a low state (off).

### Reading and Writing

The `/proc/ibr-gpio` file serves as the interface for external commands. Writing to this file triggers the `ibr_write` function, which parses the input for a pin number and a value (0 or 1). It then either turns the pin on or off based on this value.

Reading from this file calls `ibr_read`, which currently returns a static message. This can be expanded to report the status of the GPIO pins if needed.

## Why It Works

### Direct Hardware Interaction

By using memory-mapped IO, the driver interacts directly with the hardware registers of the GPIO, leading to fast and efficient pin control. This method bypasses the need for more complex interfaces and allows the driver to operate with minimal latency and overhead.

### Simple Interface

The use of a `/proc` file for controlling the GPIO pins simplifies the interface, making it accessible even to users and developers who are not familiar with kernel programming. The format `<pin number>,<value>` is intuitive, allowing for straightforward scripting and testing.

### Modular Design

The driver is designed as a kernel module, which means it can be dynamically loaded and unloaded from the kernel as needed. This modularity makes it ideal for educational purposes and for environments where flexibility is required.

## Conclusion

This GPIO driver leverages the Linux kernel's capabilities to provide a powerful yet user-friendly method for controlling Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. Its direct manipulation of hardware registers ensures efficiency, while its simple user interface promotes accessibility.

## Further Improvements

Future versions of the driver could auto-detect the Raspberry Pi model to dynamically choose the correct GPIO base address and possibly introduce interrupt-driven GPIO control for more complex applications.
